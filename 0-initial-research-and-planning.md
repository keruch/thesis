# Initial Research and Planning

1. Literature Review:
    - Study foundational papers and resources on TSS, multi-party computation, and related cryptographic concepts.
    - Compile a glossary of key terms to be used throughout the thesis.
    - Prepare and analyze a list of references.
2. Documentation Drafting:
    - Write the introductory sections, covering:
        - Overview of TSS technology and its importance in public key cryptography.
        - Real-world applications and examples of TSS usage.
        - Explanation of how TSS enhances security in distributed systems.
