# Analysis of Existing Solutions

1. Examine THORChain TSS Implementation:
    - Review the codebase and documentation (or lack thereof).
    - Identify specific issues related to maintenance, outdated dependencies, and security concerns.
2. Research Alternatives:
    - Investigate other projects (e.g., Sygma, Threshold Network) and their approaches to TSS.
    - Compile a list of existing TSS cryptography libraries in Golang.
3. Comparative Analysis:
    - Evaluate the features, pros, and cons of each library.
    - Prepare a comparison chart or table for clarity.
